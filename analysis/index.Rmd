Research website for GBRS_array.

# Goal
To evaluate the performance of GBRS by comparing its genoprob with arraybased genoprob (MUGA, MegaMUGA, and GigaMUGA).

# Approach
1. number of recombinations
2. pearson correlation between genoprobs
3. LODs on local eQTLs - accumulative and/or scatterplot

## Recombinations
* [Recombinations in DO Liver](recombinations_in_DO_Liver.html)
* [Recombinations in DO Striatum](recombinations_in_DO_Striatum.html)

## Pearson correlation between genoprobs
* [Pearson correlation between genoprobs](cor.html)

## LODs on local eQTLs
* [LODs on local eQTLs](LOD_eqtl.html)
