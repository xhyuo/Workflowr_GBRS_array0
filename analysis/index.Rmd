Research website for GBRS_array.

# Goal
To evaluate the performance of GBRS by comparing its genoprob with arraybased genoprob (MUGA, MegaMUGA, and GigaMUGA).

# Approach
1. number of recombinations
2. pearson correlation between genoprobs
3. LODs on local eQTLs - accumulative and/or scatterplot

## Recombinations
* [Recombinations in DO Liver MUGA](recombinations_in_DO_Liver_MUGA.html)
* [Recombinations in DO Liver MEGAMUGA](recombinations_in_DO_Liver_MEGAMUGA.html)
* [Recombinations in DO Striatum](recombinations_in_DO_Striatum.html)

## Pearson correlation between genoprobs
* [Pearson correlation between MUGA and GBRS](cor_DO_Liver_GBRS_MUGA.html)

## LODs on local eQTLs
* [LODs on local eQTLs](LOD_eqtl.html)
